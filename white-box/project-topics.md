1. Exploring neural network performance with frozen neurons (with fixed weights)
    - The goal is to investigate the variation in performance of the trained model (accuracy, F1 score, others) as a function of the number of neurons that are kept “frozen” i.e. not updated during the backpropagation but, instead, kept fixed at the initialization value (there might be an
 extension to this exercise to consider arbitrary values). 
    - “Frozen neurons” can be chosen randomly with uniform distribution among the neurons.
 
2. Deep fake detection challenge
    - We will use the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge/overview
    - Explore different deep neural network architectures 
    - Copying existing notebooks will result in disqualification 
    - The solution should be using tensorflow APIs 

3. Textual entailment task
    - Given two sentences classify if first sentence follows from second sentence or if they are unrelated
    - We will use two datasets for this task Fever 2.0 dataset https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/fever.public/fever2-fixers-dev.jsonl and https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news-pair-classification-challenge

4. Background news linking task from TREC 2020
    - see the details here http://trec-news.org/guidelines-2020.pdf

5. Fake news detection using BERT for Nordic languages
    - We have a lot of data in English, but very little in Norwegian
    - Collect Norwegian data and apply BERT multilingual https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/multilingual.md
    - Also explore the multilingual solutions
    - Transfer learning to fine tune the model for English to make it work for Norwegian

6. Analyzing Historical Seasonal Influenza Movement Globally

    - Seasonal influenza usually breaks out during winter in temperate climates, and during the wet season in tropical areas. 
    - Using historical data from the World Health Organization (WHO), examine how influenza spreads between countries by visualizing the data geographically, or through an interactive website. See if your findings line up with the transmission zones as defined by the WHO https://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/Influenza_transmission_zones.pdf.

    - You can inspect the data here: https://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/flunet/en/
    
7. Develop a robust model that can simultaneously detect and classify traffic-signs.
    - Dataset and description: https://www.crowdanalytix.com/contests/traffic-sign-detection-and-classification
    - Copying existing notebooks will result in disqualification

8. Norwegian Sentiment Analysis
    - Sentiment Analysis is the task of automatically identifying the opinions, attitudes or emotions that are expressed by subjective information in text.
    - Datasets: https://github.com/ltgoslo/norec or http://reclab.idi.ntnu.no/dataset/

9. Improve the Transformer's efficiency by using LSH. Apply for time-series forecasting, image or text generation problems.
