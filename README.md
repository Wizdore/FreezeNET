# FreezeNET
Its a neural network watermarking system.
It can be used to license trained neural networks with watermark embedding and protect it from unauthorized redistributing. It can also be used in cryptocoin mining proof of work where instead of solving crypto hashes coin miners train neural network and embed watermark with our system as a verification that they trained the network.
